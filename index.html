        <p>When did you last check the health of your codebase? How often do you think about the code quality of your web application? Do you have time to take a step back and consider the bigger picture?<p>

        <p>If your answers are "yesterday morning", "twice a week" and "yes, of course" then congratulations: you are among the top 1% of the software industry and you can safely close this window - you don't need our help. But if your answers differ - read on!</p>

        <p><strong>We have a solution for you - Codebase Health Check.</strong> What is Codebase Health Check?</p>

        <p class="highlight-box">
          Codebase Health Check is a detailed code quality report of your entire Ruby on Rails application, created just for you.
        </p>

      <h2>
        Why do I need a code quality report?
      </h2>

      <div class="section">
        <p>
          People don't discuss clean code practices merely for the sake of aesthetics. Code is written to deliver a business value. Low quality code slows down future growth. It negatively impacts your ability to implement new features. It increases the cost of maintaining the software. <strong>In short, a bad codebase costs you a lot of money!</strong> 
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, it's really hard to think about this wider perspective when new features are what matter most <i>right now</i>. Fortunately, there are external experts who can evaluate your code's health for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Codebase Health Check is your unique chance to get a second opinion on the quality of your code. It's a fresh look from the perspective of someone who wasn't involved in writing the original code. This report allows you to determine the code quality in your project. It contains practical tips and suggestions on what should be improved.
        </p>

      <h2>
        What will be covered?
      </h2>

      <div class="section">
        <p>
        We will cover things like:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><span>architecture of the application</span></li>
          <li><span>adherence to best programming practices</span></li>
          <li><span>division into smaller components</span></li>
          <li><span>application of design patterns</span></li>
          <li><span>gotchas which can bite you</span></li>
          <li><span>potential performance bottlenecks</span></li>
          <li><span>selection of dependencies</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We won't report on minor issues like inconsistent indentation, the use of old Ruby syntax or unnecessary parenthesis. That's what code linters are for. <strong>Instead, we focus on things which cannot be automated</strong> and offer the condensed knowledge about building higher quality web applications.
